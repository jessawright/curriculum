# curriculum

This is a loose curriculum for myself. It is based off of my own starting point, things I personally want to learn more about, curriculums written by others, and a survey of job requirements for the sort of jobs I am targeting. Items with boxes are things I specifically intend to read/do, with the rest being looser ideas/topics for intended study without specific plans.
